# shift-sync

`shift-sync` is a tool for syncing on-shift users between arbitrary systems.
For example, you can sync on-call users from a Better Stack schedule to a Slack group.

The guiding principle of `shift-sync`'s design is that adding new integrations should be easy.
Simply specify the configuration details and implement the source or destination interface.
Contributions are very welcome!
